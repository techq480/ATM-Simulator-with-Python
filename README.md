## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses only Python standard library)

### Installation Steps

1. **Download/Clone the project files**
   ```bash
   # Create project directory
   mkdir atm_simulator
   cd atm_simulator
   ```

2. **Create the modules directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir modules
   touch modules/__init__.py
   ```

3. **Add all Python files to their respective locations**
   - Place `main.py` in the root directory
   - Place all module files in the `modules/` directory

4. **Make the main file executable (optional)**
   ```bash
   chmod +x main.py
   ```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### Command Line Execution
```bash
python main.py
```

### Alternative Execution Methods
```bash
# If you have Python 3 specifically
python3 main.py

# Direct execution (if made executable)
./main.py
```

## üë§ Test Accounts

The application comes with pre-configured test accounts:

| Account Number | PIN  | Name          | Balance    | Status  | Notes                    |

ls -la modules/

# Verify __init__.py exists in modules directory
ls -la modules/__init__.py
```

#### Permission Denied (Unix/Linux/Mac)
```bash
# Make the file executable
chmod +x main.py

# Or run with python explicitly
python main.py
```

| "Account is locked" | 3 failed PIN attempts | Use a different account or restart program |
| "Insufficient funds" | Withdrawal > balance | Check balance first, withdraw smaller amount |
| "Daily limit exceeded" | Transaction exceeds limits | Split large transactions across multiple days |

## üîÑ Extending the Application

### Adding New Features
The modular design makes it easy to add features:

2. **Additional Validation**: Extend `validation.py` module
3. **Enhanced UI**: Modify `user_interface.py` for new displays
4. **Data Persistence**: Enhance `database.py` for file/database storage

### Code Style Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guide
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Add comprehensive error handling
